  My personal mission aligns with some spiritual leaders and brilliant minds like Elon Musk, enhance the human consciousness
  so that we as human species achieve our potential, I hope to contribute via my writings, stories and essays to the universal
  enterprise which I can put in these simple words:  **reach a full fledged life**

  Unlike other species the human being is a mystery, we do belong to this world and yet we create some distance from this world
  itself and here again we feel like we are strangers in this world and we don't belong to it, thus our **status** among other
  creatures or toward what we call the wolrd is **a mystery**

  This separation operated by our consciousness is the source of both our misery and grandeur. We can embrace by our mind the whole universe
  and yet it still remains a strange and mysterious place. So here come all the human endeavor since the dawn of Reason to fill 
  this gap, we built, invented, created science, philosophy, litterature, systems to understand ourselves and the world.

  I believe that a full fledged life will be achieved as long as we continue to explore this separation operated by our mind. How?
  By enchancing our consciousness. The more we become conscious the more we create some unity with the world and less we become
  miserable. We will need then practice and clarity, some sort of sport for both the mind and the body (or that which is not mind),
  or put in other words we need *action* and action supposes *direction* or *mission*, here both mind and body come at play together
  to join the dance of the *universe*.

  We need to take care of our being by feeding the mind with clarity, knowledge and critical conscious thinking and the body with
  proper food and good amount of conscious movements and direct all toward our personal mission. So before all, you need to figure out
  your purpose or work to create one, there is no difference, a purpose doesn't come up like that by pure chance, all you need to do 
  is to be conscious about your emotions and thoughts and states of your being in all circumstances, intercations and aspects of your
  life. By being more conscious and creating some distance you'll discover with time your inner strengths and what make you unique 
  and special and then you will become aware of the direction or purpose your life should aim at.
