The arguement estabilishes the existence of nonexistent entities like Pegasus or Santa Claus
Let's examine this sentence : "Pegasus does not exist" (s1)
We can present the argument in numbered form like this:

(1) The sentence s1 is true
(2) For the s1 to be true it must be at least meaningful
(3) For the s1 to be meaningful each part of the sentence must itself be meaningful
(4) The word 'Pegasus' is a name
(5) A name names something
(6) so 'Pegasus' names something
(7) Therefore there is something that is Pegasus
(8) conclusion: There is Pegasus

In other words, this is an entity in which we should believe given the sentences we take to be true.
So what we are talking about when we say that Pegasus and Santa Claus do not exist if not Pegaus and Sana Claus ?
This the ontological puzzle, it seems that just accepting the claim that something does not exist commits us
to its being.
