Organization helps to put you on track, Today I completed my learning process schedule. Here's some detailsÂ :

I have two learning objectives, one is to upgrade my English speaking and writing to the next level, am now intermediate B1 and I plan to become C1 in a spacetime of 3 months (24 weeks). The material learning is English Grammar In Use book. The book is split in sections and I'll study one section per week, at the end of each week i should write some short essay as an assignment or a small project.

My second learning objective is to take [**MIT course**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/index.htm) intitled **Computation Structues**, like with English I should complete a section each week along with the assignments. I created an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of my learning progress and objectives fulfillment.

I think I did well today, i was somehow tired after past two days of continuous work and preparation as a teacher. Teaching demands time, a strong mind and energy, but i am glad that i managed to schedule my mid-term learning and more importantly that I've written down my thoughts and plans and share them with the public.

See you soon.
