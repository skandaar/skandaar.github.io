Orgnanization helps to put you on the move, Today I completed my learning process schedule.
Here's some details :

I have two learning objectives, one is to upgrade my English speaking and writing to the next level, 
am now inetrmediate B1 and I plan to become C1 in a spacetime of 3 months (24 weeks). The material
learning is **English Grammar In Use** book. The book is split in sections and I'll study one section
per week, at the end of each week i shoiuld write some short essay and publish it here as an assignement 
or a small project.

My second learning objective is to take the [**MIT course**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/index.htm) intitled **Computation Structues**, like with 
English each week I should complete a section each week along with the assignements.
I created an Excel spreed sheet to keep track of my learning progress and objetives fullfilement.

I think I did well today, i was somehow tired after past two days of continuous work and preparation as a teacher. Teaching
demands time, a strong mind and energy, but i am glad that i managed to schedule my mid-term learning and more importantly
that I've written down my thoughts and plans and share them on the website. See you soon.
