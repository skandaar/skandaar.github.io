### To finish you have to start ###

It's been 5 days now that I initiated my English learning process, as planned I studied about 30 min to 50 min every evening.
Everything seems alright, I felt some difficulty at the begining to get in the **mindset** of the new learning path, I hope not interrupt 
this process, I'm aware that It'll take time for the new learning process to settle and become part of my daily **routines**. As long as I go
easy and in small steps I don't feel like I'll get frustrated.
