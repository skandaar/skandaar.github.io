#### My Morning Routines List

But here's few words for why i did create such list. For two interdependent reasons :

1. To take advantage of [auto-pilot system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) or in other words to activate the automatic brain, this would help to reduce time and effort hence, the productivity.

2. In order to achieve that you need practice and a clear vision of your important daily routines that will make a change.

*Meditate (10 min)* ---> *Tidy the bed (5 min) ---> *Make hot water (2 min)* ---> *Practice 10 push ups (3 min)* ---> *Wash and toothbrush (5 min)* ---> *Make breakfast (10 min)* ---> *Change clothes (10 min)*  

See you soon.
