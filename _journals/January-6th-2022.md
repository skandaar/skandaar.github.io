I've managed to install some order and tidying in my home. The kitchen was a mess, now i can 
go in and out without guilt and **negative feelings**, I know amd not done and never will be with
when it comes to take care of cleaning up the kitchen, this must be a daily routine to inject 
into habits of my life style, because the mess is created every day and needs to be dealt with
immediately before it comes a mountain of disorder.

See you soon.
