Not every day one can get up in a good mood, one must accept the fact that we can't control everything
happening within us. Nonetheless we have to wake up and we should begin the day with a positive and
happy state of mind as possible as we can, this is our daily struggle and combat. But what to do 
when you feel at the begining of the day less energetic, sad or unmotivated ?

Observe what happening within you, pay attention to your toughts and emotions, practice silence and meditate, 
this should keep you from identifying your being with those thoughts and emotions and thus you will feel less entangled.
