On the sound of the splendid composition called Nocturne in Paris by Tony Anderson I am writing these words. Music is a manifestation
of our soul, of our creative and mysterious nature. Music like everything else is a vibration that conveys life energy and penetrates
the whole universe. 

Along with this peaceful music I am drinking my black coffee, sitting in my preferred corner, thinking, planning, dreaming, drifting
with my thoughts, hoping for better things, or simply enjoying each and every second, because the sound  makes me aware of the
blissfulness of the present moment. You have all you need to live a peaceful life, just invite silence and listen. Meditate   

> I am not the body, I am not even the mind - Yoga Mantra

See you soon.
