It's hot, it's summer time. The sun affirms itslef and got the last word in this period of the year when the earth evolves near the sun
and that should last about three months before the planet gets away from its mighty deadly power. We may now hate the sun 
but we will certainly miss it in winter time, A glimpse of the sun power is just like a breeze that refreshes life in living creatures.

So this thought only simply demonstrates how we human beings as well as other creatures are dependent on this mighty powerful star. Without 
the sun we'll run out of fire power that put our cells and every atom to work, we'll be dead, pure simple. Which means that your being and
the sun are linked together, there must be some boundage and thus a tendency to unity, not only with the sun but with all that we call universe with its stars and galaxies. Our tiny existence and significance dimension are linked to the whole universe.

Let that thought sink in your mind. Expand your consciousness with that thought and feel
how big, free, infinite and powerful you can be simply by realizing that you are a child of the universe, 
no less than the trees and the stars.   

> Therefore be at peace with god, whatever you conceive Him to be - Max Ehrmann

See you soon.
