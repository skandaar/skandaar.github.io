A week has passed since I decided to schedule and organize in a documented manner my learning activities and my daily routines. I must admit that I deviated from the plan, I escaped some learning sessions, I missed doing some tasks in dues times, now I got back on track. This deviation from the plan taught me a lesson which is I must reconsider my plan, to change it in order to fit well with my actual progress and day to day tasks.
