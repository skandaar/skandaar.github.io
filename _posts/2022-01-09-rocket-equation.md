This is a post for pupils in school and the ordinary man, no advanced maths needed.
We'll try to answer these questions :

How rockets fly in the sky ? Why they are so big and heavy ?

After reading this you'll understand why we should build gigantic rockets 
if we want to reach high orbits, like Elon Musk Super Heavy or the last Ariane
that carried James Webb Telescope...
